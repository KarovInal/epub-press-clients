# epub-press-chrome
Chrome extension for pushing articles to Epub Press.

## Overview
Epub Press is a service for stitching your backlog of unread articles/blogs/webpages into a customized ebook.

It takes an experience that usually sucks (staring at a bright screen and clicking through web articles) and turns it into an experience that rocks (reading on your ereader!).

## Install:

1. Download the `epub-press-<version>.crx` file from the [releases section](https://github.com/haroldtreen/epub-press-chrome/releases)
1. Open Chrome
1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
1. Drag and drop the `epub-press-<version>.crx` file onto the chrome window
1. Click **Add Extension**

1. The icon should now be in your menu bar
