# epub-press-chrome
Chrome extension for pushing articles to [Epub Press](http://epub.press).

Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Epub_Press).

## Overview
Epub Press is a service for stitching articles/blogs/webpages into a customized ebook.

More information available @ http://epub.press

#### **Why would I use this?**

Reading on an eReader is a much nicer experience then reading in a web browser.

- eReader screens are easier on your eyes.
- eBooks don't require an internet connection.
- eBooks don't have distracting ads, menus and banners. Only. Content.
- eBooks let you group information together (eg. "News from this week", "Top 10 travel articles").
- Reading with a book is more comfortable then sitting in front of a computer.
- Flipping pages is nicer then clicking through tabs.
- eBooks are easier to share with friends than lists of URLs.
